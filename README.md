Problem Descriptionnn

The goal is to build an LLM-powered (Large Language Model) application that reviews resumes and offers tailored, constructive feedback for a specific job role. This tool should assist job seekers in optimizing their resumes to better align with job descriptions and industry expectations.

Key Features & Functional Requirements:

Resume Upload/Input
- Users should be able to upload resumes in PDF or text format.
- Alternatively, users can paste their resume text into a textbox.

Job Role Selection
- Users must be able to specify the target job role (e.g., Data Scientist, Product Manager).
- Optionally, allow for uploading or pasting a job description to guide the feedback.

LLM-Powered Review Engine
- Analyze structure, content, and tone
- Provide specific feedback such as:
• Missing skills or keywords relevant to the job.
• Recommendations to improve formatting or clarity.
• Highlighting redundant or vague language.
• Suggestions to tailor experience/achievements to the job role.
- Score or rate the resume on various aspects (optional).

Output Format
- Clearly structured feedback, possibly section-wise (Education, Experience, Skills, etc.)

User Interface:

- Web-based interface (using Streamlit, Flask, etc.).
- User-friendly experience for uploading resumes and viewing feedback.

Security & Privacy:

- Ensure uploaded resumes are not stored or exposed publicly.
- (Optional) Include a disclaimer about AI usage and privacy.

Technical Guidelines:

- Programming Language: Python (preferred)
- Models: OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, Mistral, or open-source models like LLaMA, depending on your access.
- Libraries:
• langchain, openai/anthropic SDKs, pdfminer.six, PyMuPDF or pdfplumber(for PDF parsing)
• streamlit, flask, or gradio (for UI)
• pydantic, typer, fastapi (optional, for structured code or APIs)

Bonus Features (Optional):
